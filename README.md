What is Jenkins?

Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) is the most important part of DevOps that is used to integrate various DevOps stages. Jenkins is the most famous Continuous Integration tool, If you’ve ever wondered why Jenkins is so popular and whether it’s easy to learn, you’re in the right place. Let’s dive in and explore the fascinating world of Jenkins!
Jenkins is an open-source automation server widely used for continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) processes and written in Java. It allows developers to automate various aspects of the software development lifecycle, including building, testing, and deploying applications. Jenkins is highly extensible through its vast ecosystem of plugins, making it adaptable to a wide range of use cases and technologies.

Here are a few reasons why Jenkins is so popular:

Easy to Use: Jenkins might sound complicated, but it’s actually pretty easy to learn. It has a user-friendly interface and lots of helpful guides to get you started.
Versatility: Jenkins can do a lot of different tasks, from building code to testing it and even deploying it to servers. It’s like having a Swiss Army knife for your software development needs.
Open-Source: Jenkins is free to use and open-source, which means anyone can contribute to making it better. This also means there’s a huge community of users who can help you out if you get stuck.
Integration: Jenkins plays well with others. It can connect to lots of other tools and services commonly used in software development, like Git for version control or Slack for team communication.

What is Jenkins Used For?

Jenkins software’s popularity stems from its ability to track and monitor repetitive activities that emerge throughout a project’s development. For example, if your team is working on a project, Jenkins will continuously test your builds and alert you to any mistakes early in the process.

Its top use cases include:

Deploying code into production: If all of the tests developed for a feature or release branch are green, Jenkins or another CI system may automatically publish code to staging or production. 
Enabling task automation: If a developer is working on several environments, they will need to install or upgrade an item on each of them. If the installation or update requires more than 100 steps to complete, it will be error-prone to do it manually. Instead, you can write down all the steps needed to complete the activity in Jenkins. It will take less time, and you can complete the installation or update without difficulty. 
Reducing the time it takes to review a code: Jenkins is a CI system that may communicate with other DevOps tools and notify users when a merge request is ready to merge. This is typically the case when all tests have been passed and all other conditions have been satisfied.
Increasing code coverage: Jenkins and other CI servers may verify code to increase test coverage. The results of the tests are presented on the build pipeline, ensuring that team members adhere to the guidelines. Like code review, comprehensive code coverage guarantees that testing is a transparent process for all team members. 

What is Jenkins Pipeline?

A Jenkins Pipeline is a way to define your  software delivery process as code, allowing you to express your entire build pipeline as code. It’s a powerful feature in Jenkins that enables you to automate and manage complex CI/CD workflows in a more structured and maintainable manner.
In simpler terms, think of a Jenkins Pipeline as a script that outlines all the steps needed to build, test, and deploy your software. This script lives alongside your code in your version control system, ensuring that your entire software delivery process is versioned, reproducible, and easily sharable among team members. Pipelines are needed to run Jenkins. A pipeline is a set of steps the Jenkins server will execute to complete the CI/CD process’s necessary tasks. In the context of Jenkins, a pipeline refers to a collection of jobs (or events) connected in a specific order. It is a collection of plugins that allow the creation and integration of Continuous Delivery pipelines in Jenkins.

Jenkins Pipelines comprise a powerful technology that includes a set of tools for hosting, monitoring, compiling, and testing code or code modifications across various tools such as:  

Continuous integration server (e.g. Bamboo, Jenkins, TeamCity, CruiseControl, and others)
Source control software (e.g. SVN, CVS, Mercurial, GIT, ClearCase, Perforce, and others)
Build tools (e.g. Make, Ant, Ivy, Maven, Gradle, and others) 
Automation testing framework (e.g. Appium, Selenium, UFT, TestComplete, and others) 
There are 2 main types of Jenkins Pipeline:

Declarative Pipeline
Scripted Pipeline
